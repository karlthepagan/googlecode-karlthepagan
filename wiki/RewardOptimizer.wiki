#World of Warcraft quest reward optimizer.

= Introduction =

My paladin stands at level 58 at the doorway to Outlands, but I pause and consider what kind of a paladin I want to be. What if I want it ALL?

I want every flavor of gear for tanking, dps, solo pvp, and healing. It's hard enough to pick rewards for a cloth, but Paladins can wear every kind of armor and wield many weapons.
